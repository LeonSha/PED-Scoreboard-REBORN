# PED-Scoreboard-REBORN
Continued development of the PED Scoreboard web application for OBS, based on original application from OBS Forums User Tim Elliot (LINK: https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/ped-scoreboard.1281/)

PED Scoreboard was originally developed in early-mid 2021 by Tim Elliot. Designed for use with baseball and softball, Tim had the goal of giving sports streamers the access to a free, open-source scorebug that could be integrated with Open Broadcaster Software (OBS). Whether using the GUI on offer or the built-in text files with OBS, the software offered great flexibility to all sports streamers.

PED Scoreboard REBORN has been created to help carry on the development of Tim's excellent work, as it offers an excellent experience for baseball and softball fans looking to up the quality of their videos and/or livestreams.


## Features

### The "Original" Scorebug
Just like the ones you see on TV. Track the team scores, inning, runners on base; all in a condensed and sleek package.

### The "Innings" Scorebug
Get a count of how many runs have been scored by each team in each inning. The scorebug will automatically shift to show the most recent innings, making sure you can stay up-to-date with the latest in the game.
